# Have you ever feel; scared, depressed and confused?

    All the three idk, Im surely felt any of those some time, but like; a phase of my life that I felt those three feelings constantly... lets see:

**scared**: when I was invited to get a job on Cd MX (outside of my state)     |   When the pandemic hit I thought I could loose a fam member or that I'll suffer by illness     |   Feeling that I would no be able to survived with the money I was making

**depressed**: The need to have a girl in my life. But that only last up to 19... that was rock bottom I dont think that I been REAL depresed after that

**confused**: In pandemic I felt confused by the ADHD and my personality, I couldnt grasp who I really was. And in the middel of that I got wrapped in the spell of a women who makes me feel good and bad at the same time

> It seems like I was kinda lucky to not been depresed in my youth only when I expirment love the first time, and that only last for like 1 year. After that I've been able to feel free even on pandemic I was lucky to feel very happy

> I felt only confused at the of pandemic due my lack of confidence, due my lack of movement and poor social interactions. When I could get a job that makes me talk to new people and move alot I started to recover my strength and focus.

> And about feeling scared, that something that I feel sometimes but I've always been able to pass through it.
